# Project Purpose

**Palladium Automation** is a wrapper project for automating Hornet GPU/GPGPU hardware development on Palladium emulator.

## Key Objectives

1. **RTL Analysis**: Analyze hornet Verilog/SystemVerilog code for debugging and optimization
2. **Remote Execution**: Execute build/simulation scripts on ga53pd01 compute server via SSH
3. **Result Analysis**: Collect and analyze Palladium emulation results
4. **Integrated Workflow**: Provide one-stop development environment from analysis to execution

## Hornet Project

Hornet is a GPU/GPGPU hardware design project:
- **Language**: Verilog/SystemVerilog
- **Target**: Palladium emulator for hardware verification
- **Repository**: https://github.com/tier4/hornet
- **Location in this project**: `hornet/` directory (git cloned)
