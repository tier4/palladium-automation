# list of tool names to exclude. We recommend not excluding any tools, see the readme for more details.
# Below is the complete list of tools for convenience.
# To make sure you have the latest list of tools, and to view their descriptions, 
# execute `uv run scripts/print_tool_overview.py`.
#
#  * `activate_project`: Activates a project by name.
#  * `check_onboarding_performed`: Checks whether project onboarding was already performed.
#  * `create_text_file`: Creates/overwrites a file in the project directory.
#  * `delete_lines`: Deletes a range of lines within a file.
#  * `delete_memory`: Deletes a memory from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `execute_shell_command`: Executes a shell command.
#  * `find_referencing_code_snippets`: Finds code snippets in which the symbol at the given location is referenced.
#  * `find_referencing_symbols`: Finds symbols that reference the symbol at the given location (optionally filtered by type).
#  * `find_symbol`: Performs a global (or local) search for symbols with/containing a given name/substring (optionally filtered by type).
#  * `get_current_config`: Prints the current configuration of the agent, including the active and available projects, tools, contexts, and modes.
#  * `get_symbols_overview`: Gets an overview of the top-level symbols defined in a given file.
#  * `initial_instructions`: Gets the initial instructions for the current project.
#     Should only be used in settings where the system prompt cannot be set,
#     e.g. in clients you have no control over, like Claude Desktop.
#  * `insert_after_symbol`: Inserts content after the end of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `insert_at_line`: Inserts content at a given line in a file.
#  * `insert_before_symbol`: Inserts content before the beginning of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `list_dir`: Lists files and directories in the given directory (optionally with recursion).
#  * `list_memories`: Lists memories in Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `onboarding`: Performs onboarding (identifying the project structure and essential tasks, e.g. for testing or building).
#  * `prepare_for_new_conversation`: Provides instructions for preparing for a new conversation (in order to continue with the necessary context).
#  * `read_file`: Reads a file within the project directory.
#  * `read_memory`: Reads the memory with the given name from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `remove_project`: Removes a project from the Serena configuration.
#  * `replace_lines`: Replaces a range of lines within a file with new content.
#  * `replace_symbol_body`: Replaces the full definition of a symbol.
#  * `restart_language_server`: Restarts the language server, may be necessary when edits not through Serena happen.
#  * `search_for_pattern`: Performs a search for a pattern in the project.
#  * `summarize_changes`: Provides instructions for summarizing the changes made to the codebase.
#  * `switch_modes`: Activates modes by providing a list of their names
#  * `think_about_collected_information`: Thinking tool for pondering the completeness of collected information.
#  * `think_about_task_adherence`: Thinking tool for determining whether the agent is still on track with the current task.
#  * `think_about_whether_you_are_done`: Thinking tool for determining whether the task is truly completed.
#  * `write_memory`: Writes a named memory (for future reference) to Serena's project-specific memory store.

  # Palladium Automation Project

  This is a wrapper project for hornet GPU/GPGPU development with Palladium emulation automation.

  ## Project Structure

  - **hornet/**: Cloned hornet repository (GPU/GPGPU RTL)
    - hornet/src/: RTL source files (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
    - hornet/eda/: EDA tool configurations and testbenches
    - hornet/tb/: Testbench files

  - **scripts/**: Automation scripts
    - scripts/claude_to_ga53pd01.sh: SSH sync execution to ga53pd01

  - **workspace/**: Execution results
    - workspace/etx_results/.archive/: Archived results from ga53pd01

  ## Workflow

  1. **RTL Analysis**: Use Serena MCP to analyze hornet Verilog/SystemVerilog files
  2. **Script Generation**: Generate build/test scripts for ga53pd01
  3. **Remote Execution**: Execute via SSH using scripts/claude_to_ga53pd01.sh
  4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze results and iterate

  ## Remote Execution

  Build and simulation are executed on ga53pd01 compute server:
  - Host: ga53pd01 (via bastion 10.108.64.1)
  - User: henmi
  - Working directory: /proj/tierivemu/work/henmi/

  ## Key Commands

  ```bash
  # Execute script on ga53pd01 (SSH sync mode - recommended, 2-3 seconds)
  ./scripts/claude_to_ga53pd01.sh /path/to/script.sh
  ```
